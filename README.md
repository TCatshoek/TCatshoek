### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tom! I like building all kinds of stuff! For my day job I mostly focus on software, but I'm also interested in hardware (hacking), electronics, and CAD.

Currently, I am:
- ðŸ˜Ž working on HPC scheduling systems 
- ðŸ¦€ still trying to write more Rust!
- ðŸŒŽ doing full stack web stuff with Next.js and FastAPI
- ðŸ“– not writing enough about my tech adventures at [tom.catshoek.dev](https://tom.catshoek.dev)
- âš¡ building LED Matrices with KiCAD, and writing software to drive them!
