### Hi there 👋

I'm Tom! I like building all kinds of stuff! For my day job I mostly focus on software, but I'm also interested in hardware (hacking), electronics, and CAD.

Currently, I am:
- 🔭 working on refactoring a research C++ codebase for increased maintainability and testability
- 🦀 using Rust more and more and loving it!
- 🌎 doing full stack web stuff with Next.js and FastAPI
- 📖 writing about my tech adventures at [tom.catshoek.dev](https://tom.catshoek.dev)
- ⚡ building LED Matrices with KiCAD, and writing software to drive them!
